    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Margherita Pizza is another personal favorite of mine!</p>
    <p>It is truly an Italian classic, simple yet captivating (most of the time!). Thus this recipe is perfect
        for beginners since it doesn't require a lot of ingredients!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lbs (453g) classic pizza dough ball (you can use store-bought pizza dough too)</li>   
        <li>½ cup Pizza Sauce (use your preferred brand)</li>
        <li>2 cups Fresh Sliced Mozzarella</li>
        <li>¼ cup Parmesan Cheese</li>
        <li>Fresh Basil Leaves</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1</li>
        <p>
            Preheat oven to 475F. Prepare all ingredients for the margherita pizza.
        </p>
        <li>Step 2</li>
        <p>
            On a floured surface, roll the dough into the desired shape. Top it off with pizza sauce, pieces of fresh mozzarella and sprinkle a bit of parmesan cheese.
        </p>
        <li>Step 3</li>
        <p>
            Bake pizza for about 14 minutes or until the crust is lightly browned and the cheese is golden. 
        </p>
        <li>Step 4</li>
        <p>
            Remove pizza from the oven, top it off with fresh basil. Serve pizza right away, while the cheese is all melted.
